I used CursorAI [https://www.cursor.so/] and ChatGPT [https://chat.openai.com/] to assist in developing parts of my
Android Studio project that involved repetitive code patterns or concepts I needed assistance on.
These tools have helped me in these aspects:

- Sync the Gemini API client into my Android Studio project

- Redesign and refine the UI layout

- Create and structure my Room database

- Debug errors and resolve runtime issues throughout development

The outputs from these tools were modified to suit my app's structure and logic. I reviewed all suggestions,
adopted relevant solutions and ensured that I understood all implementations.
